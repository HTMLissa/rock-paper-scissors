# rock-paper-scissors

A simple rock, paper, scissors game. The user can choose between three buttons while the computer makes a random selection. User and computer can play against each other and view the current score until one of them reaches 5 points. The winner is then announced. 

In the course of this project I was able to apply and deepen my knowledge in DOM manipulation.
